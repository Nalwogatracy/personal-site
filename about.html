        Tracy and Shilla were happy siblings who loved and respected each other. They were the second and third born in a joyous family of two boys and two girls.

                Every morning, the family would wake up and have breakfast together. They would laugh and talk about their plans for the day. After breakfast, Tracy and Shilla would help out around the house by making their beds, cleaning their rooms, and taking out the trash.
                
                After chores were done, Tracy and Shilla would play together. They would play tag, hide-and-seek, and board games. They would also ride their bikes, play basketball, and go swimming.
                
                Tracy loved spending time with Shilla. She was her best friend. They could always make each other laugh, and they were always there for each other when they needed support.
                
                One day, Tracy was feeling sad. She had had a bad day at school, and she didn't know what to do. She went home and told Shilla how she was feeling.
                
                Shilla was very understanding. She told Tracy that it was okay to feel sad, and that she was there for her. She gave Tracy a hug and told her that she loved her.
                
                Shilla made Tracy feel so much better. Tracy was so grateful to have her in her life.
                
                Another day, Tracy and Shilla were fighting. Tracy didn't know what to do. She didn't want to get involved, but she also didn't want her sister to be mad at her.
                
                Tracy decided to talk to her parents about the situation. Her parents told her that it was normal for siblings to fight sometimes. They said that the important thing was to learn how to resolve their conflicts peacefully.
                
                Tracy's parents helped her and Shilla to talk to each other about their problems. They helped them to understand each other's perspectives and to reach a compromise.
                
                Tracy was so glad that her parents were able to help her and Shilla. She knew that their bond was even stronger now.
                
                Tracy loved her joyous family. She was so grateful to have such loving and supportive siblings. She knew that no matter what happened in life, she could always count on them.
